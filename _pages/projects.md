## Project 1:[Equity Research and Analysis, Cornell University]
- **Description**: Conducted thorough fundamental analysis of small-cap biopharmaceutical companies, including detailed research on R&D pipelines and development of success rate weighted DCF valuation models
- **Role**: Utilized time series analysis, linear regression models, and comparable company valuation methods to evaluate stock performances and provide investment recommendations, supporting portfolio optimization efforts for the Cayuga Fund
- **Technologies**: Financial Analysis, Financial Modeling, Fundamental Analysis, Regression, Python

## Project 2: [Callable Convertible Bond Pricing, Cornell University]
- **Description**: Generate an automated pricing model to price callable convertile bond.
- **Role**: Employed VBA to generate multi-step binary trees of stock prices to evaluate callable convertible bondsâ€™ prices. Utilized the Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) model to forecast random fluctuations in future interest rates within a no-arbitrage framework and incorporated company credit ratings and market interest rate changes to accurately price callable convertible bonds, ensuring market price deviation within a controlled range of 3%-5%.
- **Technologies**: Python, VBA, R, Financial Modeling

## Project 3: [Portfolio Management, University of Illinois]
- **Description**: Use a top-down approach to predict economic conditions in the future and select stocks to build up portfolio.
- **Role**: Utilized R to develop machine learning models (including linear regression, random forest, SVM) to predict inflation rates and economic growth trends in the US, identifying key economic cycle turning points and potential industries. Built DCF and comparable companies valuation models to assess company values, and applied scenario analysis and Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate stock and portfolio performance under various market conditions, optimizing portfolio weights for optimal risk-adjusted returns
- **Technologies**: R, Machine Learning, Financial Modeling, Risk Management, Scenario Analysis, Monte Carlo Simulation
