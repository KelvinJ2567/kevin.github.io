## Project 1:[Tactical Asset Allocation, Cornell University]
- **Description**:
  - Explore outperforming asset classes under different economic stages to implement a tactical asset allocation strategy across the time
- **Role**:
  - Utilized Black-Litterman model and Markowitz model to develop optimal portfolio weights on different assets and adjust the portfolio holding when the business cycle change
- **Technologies**:
  - Python, Machine Learning, Black-Litterman Model, Markowitz model
 
## Project 2:[Market Neutral Trading Strategy, Cornell University]
- **Description**:
  - Discover trading pairs among Russel 3000 stocks and develop trading strategies on those pairs
- **Role**:
  - Applied PCA to lower the data dimension and selected 10 pairs of stocks
  - Developed a Resistance Support Relative Strength (RSRS) model to help process the trading signal
- **Technologies**:
  - Python, Machine Learning, PCA

## Project 3:[Equity Research and Analysis, Cornell University]
- **Description**:
  - Conducted thorough fundamental analysis of small-cap biopharmaceutical companies, including detailed research on R&D pipelines and development of success rate weighted DCF valuation models
- **Role**:
  - Utilized time series analysis, linear regression models, and comparable company valuation methods to evaluate stock performances and provide investment recommendations, supporting portfolio optimization efforts for the Cayuga Fund
- **Technologies**:
  - Financial Analysis, Financial Modeling, Fundamental Analysis, Regression, Python

## Project 4: [Callable Convertible Bond Pricing, Cornell University]
- **Description**:
  - Generate an automated pricing model to price callable convertile bond
- **Role**:
  - Employed VBA to generate multi-step binary trees of stock prices to evaluate callable convertible bondsâ€™ prices
  - Utilized the Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) model to forecast random fluctuations in future interest rates within a no-arbitrage framework and incorporated company credit ratings and market interest rate changes to accurately price callable convertible bonds, ensuring market price deviation within a controlled range of 3%-5%
- **Technologies**:
  - Python, VBA, R, Financial Modeling

## Project 5: [Portfolio Management, University of Illinois]
- **Description**:
  - Use a top-down approach to predict economic conditions in the future and select stocks to build up portfolio
- **Role**:
  - Utilized R to develop machine learning models (including linear regression, random forest, SVM) to predict inflation rates and economic growth trends in the US, identifying key economic cycle turning points and potential industries
  - Built DCF and comparable companies valuation models to assess company values, and applied scenario analysis and Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate stock and portfolio performance under various market conditions, optimizing portfolio weights for optimal risk-adjusted returns
- **Technologies**:
  - R, Machine Learning, Financial Modeling, Risk Management, Scenario Analysis, Monte Carlo Simulation

## Project 6: [Inflation and Growth Forecasting, University of Illinois]
- **Description**:
  - Use Machine Learning to predict inflation and economic growth in the near future
- **Role**:
  - Applied Lasso and Random Forest models to determine the importance of each economic factor in forecasting models and concluded production related factors are the main factors in both forecasting
  - Analyzed monthly data since 1980 and developed five forecasting machine learning models to evaluate the impact of Covid pandemic on the inflation and growth forecasting
- **Technologies**:
  - R, Machine Learning
